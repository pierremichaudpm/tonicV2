# Strapi CMS Deployment Issue

## Current Problem
The CMS returns 404 when accessing `/admin` because Strapi is not running in the deployed environment.

## Why This Happens
1. Replit deployments only run the main Express server (`npm start`)
2. Strapi requires its own separate process to run
3. The deployment doesn't automatically start both services

## Solutions

### Option 1: Run Strapi Locally (Recommended for Development)
- Use Strapi in your local Replit environment where you can run both services
- The website content is already static and doesn't require CMS to be live

### Option 2: Use Alternative CMS Hosting
- Deploy Strapi separately on a service like:
  - Render.com (free tier available)
  - Railway.app
  - Heroku
- Then update your website to connect to the external CMS

### Option 3: Simplify to Static Content
- Since your website already has fallback to static JSON files
- You can update content directly in the JSON files:
  - `/client/public/js/jobs-data.js`
  - `/client/public/js/communiques-data.js`
- This works perfectly without needing a live CMS

## Current Working Solution
Your website is fully functional with:
- All pages working (French/English)
- Jobs and news displaying from static files
- Professional presentation ready

The CMS was successfully integrated but requires separate hosting for production use.
