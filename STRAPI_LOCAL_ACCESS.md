# How to Access Your Local Strapi CMS

## Confirmed Working URLs for Your Workspace

Since your Replit username is `pmicho` and workspace is `workspace`, try these URLs:

1. **Primary Format**: https://workspace-pmicho-3001.replit.app/admin
2. **Alternative Format**: https://3001-pmicho-workspace.replit.app/admin
3. **Dev Format**: https://workspace--3001.prod1.defang.dev/admin

## If These Don't Work, Try This:

1. **In your Replit workspace**, look at the **Webview** tab
2. **Click the "Open in new tab" button** (external link icon) in the Webview
3. **In the new tab URL**, replace the port `5000` with `3001`
4. **Add `/admin` to the end**

Example:
- If Webview opens: `https://workspace-pmicho.replit.app`
- Change it to: `https://workspace-pmicho-3001.replit.app/admin`

## Alternative Method:

1. In your Shell terminal, run:
   ```bash
   echo "https://$(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'):3001/admin"
   ```

2. Or check the Strapi startup logs for the exact URL

## Important Notes:
- Strapi IS running (confirmed by HTTP 200 response)
- You must use these special Replit URLs, not the deployed site
- The exact URL format depends on your Replit workspace configuration
