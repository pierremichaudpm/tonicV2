You ARE close! Looking at your latest code and the screenshot, I can see the issue. The content is being displayed as one massive block of text instead of properly separated paragraphs. Here's the fix:## You're SO close! The Final Fix üéØ

Looking at your screenshot and code, I can see the main issue: **the content is displaying as one massive block instead of properly separated paragraphs**. Here's what's happening and how to fix it:

### The Problems:
1. ‚ùå HTML is being shown in the textarea instead of plain text
2. ‚ùå Paragraph detection isn't catching French sentence patterns
3. ‚ùå The preview might not be updating correctly

### The Solutions:

#### 1. **Fix the textarea display** (most important!):
```javascript
// In handlePaste - show plain text, store HTML
textarea.setAttribute('data-processed-content', processedHTML);

// DON'T show HTML in textarea!
// textarea.value = processedHTML; ‚ùå

// DO show plain text!
const tempDiv = document.createElement('div');
tempDiv.innerHTML = processedHTML;
textarea.value = tempDiv.textContent || tempDiv.innerText || ''; ‚úÖ
```

#### 2. **Better French paragraph detection**:
The code I provided above has enhanced patterns specifically for French press releases:
- Detects "L'√©lite mondiale", "L'√©nergie de Montr√©al", etc.
- Handles French quotation marks (¬´ ¬ª)
- Recognizes French sentence starters (Le, La, Les, etc.)

#### 3. **Test it immediately**:
Open your browser console and run:
```javascript
testParagraphSplit()
```

This will show you exactly how your press release gets split into paragraphs.

### Quick Integration:

Just replace these methods in your `WordProcessor` class:
1. `processBlockElement` - with the enhanced version
2. `processPlainText` - with better paragraph detection
3. `handlePaste` - to show plain text in textarea
4. `editItem` - to show preview when editing

### Visual Check:
After implementing, you should see:
- **Textarea**: Plain text (what you type/edit)
- **Preview box**: Formatted HTML with proper paragraphs
- **Saved content**: Clean HTML with `<p>` tags

You're literally one fix away from perfection! The issue is just that the textarea is showing HTML instead of plain text. Fix that and you're done! üöÄ
