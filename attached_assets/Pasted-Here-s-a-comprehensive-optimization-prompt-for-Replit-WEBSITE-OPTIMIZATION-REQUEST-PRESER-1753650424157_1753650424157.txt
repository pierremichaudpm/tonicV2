Here's a comprehensive optimization prompt for Replit:

**WEBSITE OPTIMIZATION REQUEST - PRESERVE FUNCTIONALITY**

I need you to optimize my website for better performance. The site is currently working perfectly, so it's CRITICAL that you don't break anything.

**CURRENT WORKING STRUCTURE:**
- All files are in `client/public/`
- The site uses inline JavaScript in HTML files (no build process)
- Tailwind CSS classes are used dynamically in JavaScript

**STRICT RULES - DO NOT:**
1. ❌ Add ANY new `<script>` tags to HTML files
2. ❌ Create or reference `homepage.js` or any new JS files
3. ❌ Extract inline JavaScript from HTML files
4. ❌ Remove ANY CSS classes from Tailwind files (they look unused but are dynamically applied)
5. ❌ Change file paths or move files between directories
6. ❌ Modify the PROPERTIES array or template literal syntax `${}` in JavaScript
7. ❌ Delete any images, even if they seem unused
8. ❌ Create a build process or use the src/ folder
9. ❌ Change relative paths (must stay as css/, images/, js/)

**SAFE OPTIMIZATIONS TO PERFORM:**

1. **Image Optimization:**
   - Compress all .webp and .png files in `images/` folder
   - Maintain same filenames and locations

2. **CSS Optimization:**
   - Minify CSS files but KEEP ALL CLASSES
   - Combine shared.css and 4k-presentation.css if possible
   - Add CSS caching headers

3. **HTML Optimization:**
   - Remove unnecessary whitespace
   - Minify HTML while preserving JavaScript functionality
   - Add meta tags for better SEO if missing

4. **JavaScript Optimization:**
   - Remove console.log statements
   - Minify inline JavaScript but keep it inline
   - Do NOT extract to external files

5. **Server Optimization:**
   - Add gzip compression in server.js
   - Add cache headers for static assets (images: 1 year, CSS/JS: 1 month)
   - Enable HTTPS redirect if not present

**TESTING CHECKLIST AFTER EACH CHANGE:**
- Splash screen shows for 4.5 seconds
- Grid of 7 tiles appears with background images
- Clicking tiles shows hero view
- All navigation links work
- Both French and English pages load

**Start with image optimization first, test, then proceed with other optimizations one at a time.**
