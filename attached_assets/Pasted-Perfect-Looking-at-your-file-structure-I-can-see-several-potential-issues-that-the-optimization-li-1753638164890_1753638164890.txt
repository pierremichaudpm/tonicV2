Perfect! Looking at your file structure, I can see several potential issues that the optimization likely caused. Here's an updated, more targeted prompt for Replit based on your specific setup:

**URGENT: Fix Broken Website After Optimization - Complex Vite/Build Setup**

The optimization process broke my production site. Based on the file structure, here are the specific areas to investigate:

**FILE STRUCTURE ISSUES TO CHECK:**

1. **Path Confusion - Multiple index.html files:**
   - `/client/public/index.html` 
   - `/client/public/index-working.html` (BACKUP VERSION!)
   - `/client/src/index.html`
   - Which one is being served? The optimization may have confused these.

2. **Build Process Broken:**
   - Check `vite.config.ts` - was it modified?
   - Check `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind classes might be purged incorrectly
   - Check `postcss.config.js` - PostCSS processing might be broken
   - Is the build outputting to the correct directory?

3. **Asset Path Issues:**
   - CSS files in `/client/public/css/` - are paths correct?
   - JS files in `/client/public/js/` - especially data files like `communiques-data.js`, `emplois-data.js`
   - Images in `/client/public/images/` - check all image references

4. **Critical Files to Compare:**
   - Compare `/client/public/index.html` with `/client/public/index-working.html`
   - What are the differences? Use index-working.html as reference!

5. **Bilingual Site Issues:**
   - Check if language switching is broken
   - Verify both versions load: `index.html` and `index-en.html`
   - Same for all page pairs (emplois.html/emplois-en.html, etc.)

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**

1. **First, try this:**
   ```bash
   # Check if it's a build issue
   npm run build
   # or
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Compare working vs broken:**
   - Open `index-working.html` in browser - does it work?
   - Compare its script/link tags with current `index.html`

3. **Check server.js:**
   - Is it serving files from the correct directory?
   - Did optimization change the static file serving path?

4. **Verify file references in index.html:**
   - Are CSS files loading? Check paths like `./css/shared.css` vs `/css/shared.css` vs `css/shared.css`
   - Are JS files loading? Especially `homepage.js` and data files
   - Are Tailwind styles being applied?

5. **Check for these specific breaks:**
   - Tailwind purging too aggressively (removing used classes)
   - JavaScript minification breaking syntax
   - Data files (`*-data.js`) being corrupted or paths changed
   - Build output directory changed

**DEBUG COMMANDS TO RUN:**
```bash
# Check build output
ls -la dist/
ls -la client/dist/
ls -la client/public/

# Test the working backup
open client/public/index-working.html

# Check for syntax errors in JS files
node -c client/public/js/*.js

# See what server.js is serving
grep -n "static" server.js
```

**PRIORITY FIX ORDER:**
1. Use `index-working.html` as reference to fix `index.html`
2. Fix any build/serve configuration issues
3. Restore correct asset paths
4. Test each of the 12 HTML pages

Please start by showing me:
1. Differences between index.html and index-working.html
2. Any errors in browser console
3. What `npm run dev` or `npm run build` outputs

---

Also, **for us to help debug**, please share:
1. `/client/public/index.html` (the broken one)
2. `/client/public/index-working.html` (the working backup!)
3. Browser console errors
4. `vite.config.ts` or `server.js`

The fact that you have `index-working.html` is fantastic - that's your reference point to see exactly what the optimization changed!
