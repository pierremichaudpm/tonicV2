Great idea! Here's a comprehensive prompt you can give to Replit to thoroughly investigate and fix the optimization issues:

**CRITICAL WEBSITE REPAIR NEEDED - OPTIMIZATION BROKE PRODUCTION SITE**

My website was working perfectly before optimization. After you ran an optimization/cleanup process, the site is now completely broken. I need you to systematically investigate and fix all issues.

**INVESTIGATION STEPS:**

1. **Error Analysis:**
   - Check browser console for ALL JavaScript errors
   - Check Network tab for ALL 404/failed resource loads
   - List every error found with file name and line number

2. **File Path Audit:**
   - Verify ALL HTML files have correct paths to CSS files
   - Verify ALL HTML files have correct paths to JavaScript files
   - Check if any files were moved to different directories
   - Ensure all relative paths still work (../, ./, etc.)

3. **Code Comparison:**
   - Compare the current broken version with the last working deployment
   - Identify EVERY change made during optimization
   - List what was removed, modified, or relocated

4. **Common Breaking Points to Check:**
   - Did minification break JavaScript syntax?
   - Were "unused" functions/variables removed that were actually needed?
   - Were async/await or promises affected?
   - Were event listeners broken?
   - Were global variables renamed or removed?
   - Were CSS classes renamed that JavaScript depends on?
   - Were data attributes removed that JavaScript uses?
   - Were API endpoints or fetch calls modified?
   - Is the Claude API integration still properly configured in secrets?

5. **File Structure Review:**
   - List the complete file structure before and after optimization
   - Check if index.html is still in the root directory
   - Verify all 12 HTML files are accessible and linked correctly

6. **Specific Fixes Needed:**
   - For each error found, provide the exact fix
   - Test each fix before moving to the next
   - Ensure no new errors are introduced

7. **Testing Protocol:**
   - After each fix, reload the site and check:
     - Console errors cleared?
     - All pages load?
     - All styles applied?
     - All JavaScript functionality works?
     - All API calls succeed?

**PRIORITY ORDER:**
1. Fix index.html first
2. Fix main CSS loading
3. Fix main JavaScript loading
4. Fix page-specific issues
5. Test all 12 HTML pages

**IMPORTANT:** 
- DO NOT make any additional optimizations
- ONLY fix what's broken
- Preserve all functionality that was working before
- Comment each fix you make so we can track changes

Please start with step 1 and provide a detailed report of all errors found, then proceed with fixes one by one.

This prompt should help Replit thoroughly investigate and systematically fix the issues. Would you like me to add anything specific about your site's functionality or the Claude API integration?
