Looking at your code, I can see the issue. The paste handler is converting the processed HTML back to plain text for the textarea, but then when saving, it's processing that plain text again, which can cause content loss. Let me fix this:Now also replace the `saveItem` function to use the processed content:And also update the `showContentPreview` function to show actual content:Now add this test function to verify the paste is working:## Summary of Changes

Here's what I've fixed in your CMS:

### **1. Simplified Paste Handling**
- **Before**: Converted HTML to plain text immediately, losing formatting
- **After**: Lets normal paste happen, then processes content and stores both versions

### **2. Better Content Storage**
- **New**: Uses `data-processed-content` attribute to store the formatted HTML
- **Save function**: Uses processed content when available, prevents double-processing

### **3. Improved Preview**
- **Before**: Showed plain text preview
- **After**: Shows actual HTML with links and formatting

## **How to Test:**

1. **Replace the functions** in your HTML file with the code I provided above
2. **Open browser dev tools** (F12) and go to the Console tab
3. **Test the processing** by typing: `testPasteHandling()` in the console
4. **Try pasting** from a Word document into the content area
5. **Check the console** for messages like "🔥 PASTE EVENT TRIGGERED"

## **What to Look For:**

✅ **In Console**: Should see messages like:
- `🔥 PASTE EVENT TRIGGERED for field: content`
- `📝 Raw pasted content length: 500`
- `🔧 Processed content length: 650`

✅ **In Preview**: Should show formatted content with clickable links

✅ **When Saving**: Should see:
- `💾 Saving data: {...}`
- `✅ Créé avec succès`

## **If Still Having Issues:**

1. **Check if paste handlers are attached**: You should see in console:
   ```
   ✅ Paste handler attached to description field
   ✅ Paste handler attached to content field
   ```

2. **Try typing content manually** instead of pasting to see if the issue is with paste detection or content processing

3. **Check the network tab** in dev tools when saving to see if the request is being sent properly

4. **Run the test function** `testPasteHandling()` to verify the text processing works

Let me know what you see in the console when you try to paste content!
