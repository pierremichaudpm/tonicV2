Perfect! No Strapi. Let's get your custom CMS working with the simple backend solution.

## Here's exactly what you need to do:

### 1. **Set up the Backend in Replit**

1. **Create `server.js`** in your root directory (use the backend code I provided)
2. **Create `package.json`** in your root directory (use the package.json I provided)
3. **Create a `public` folder** and move all your current HTML files into it
4. **Update your folder structure** to look like this:

```
your-replit-project/
├── server.js                 ← NEW (backend)
├── package.json              ← NEW
├── public/                   ← MOVE everything here
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── emplois.html
│   ├── emplois-en.html
│   ├── edit-cms.html
│   ├── admin/
│   │   └── index.html        ← NEW (login page)
│   ├── css/
│   ├── js/
│   └── images/
└── data/                     ← AUTO-CREATED (stores your content)
```

### 2. **Update Your Replit Settings**

- Go to your Replit **Shell** and run: `npm install`
- In your `.replit` file, change the run command to: `node server.js`

### 3. **Replace the Strapi References**

Replace your `js/strapi-api.js` file with the updated version I provided (it removes all Strapi code).

### 4. **Set Your Admin Password**

In `server.js`, find this line and change the password:
```javascript
if (password === 'your-admin-password') {  // ← Change this to your desired password
```

### 5. **Test It**

1. **Run your project** in Replit
2. **Go to `/admin`** - you should see a login page
3. **Login with your password** - should redirect to `/edit-cms.html`
4. **Your jobs and news pages** should load data from the CMS

## Key Benefits of This Approach:

✅ **No external dependencies** - everything runs on Replit  
✅ **No database needed** - uses simple JSON files  
✅ **Works with your existing edit-cms.html** - minimal changes needed  
✅ **Bilingual support** - handles French/English content  
✅ **Simple authentication** - password-protected admin area  

## What Happens:

- Your **website visitors** see content from `/api/public/jobs` and `/api/public/news`
- Your **admin panel** (`edit-cms.html`) manages content via `/api/cms/` endpoints
- **Data is stored** in `data/jobs.json` and `data/news.json` files
- **No external services** needed - everything is self-contained
