Perfect! I found the issue. Comparing the broken `index.html` with the working version, there's only ONE difference:

**The broken version has an extra line at the very end:**
```html
<script src="js/homepage.js"></script>
```

This is right before the closing `</body>` tag. This extra script is likely:
1. **Causing conflicts** - If `homepage.js` tries to redefine the same functions or variables
2. **Not loading (404)** - If the file doesn't exist in the `js/` directory
3. **Contains errors** - If the optimization process created a broken file

**Here's the fix prompt for Replit:**

**FOUND THE ISSUE - Simple Fix Required**

The optimization added an extra script tag that's breaking everything:
```html
<script src="js/homepage.js"></script>
```

**IMMEDIATE FIX:**
1. Remove this line from `index.html` (it's the last script tag before `</body>`)
2. The site should work immediately after removing this line

**OR if the file exists:**
1. Check if `client/public/js/homepage.js` exists
2. If it does, show me its contents - it's likely causing conflicts
3. Either delete the file or fix the conflicts

**The working version doesn't have this script tag, so it's definitely the problem.**

**Quick fix you can do yourself:**I've created the fixed `index.html` for you - it's identical to your broken version but with the problematic `<script src="js/homepage.js"></script>` line removed.

**The issue is clear:**
- The optimization process added an extra script tag: `<script src="js/homepage.js"></script>`
- This script is either missing (causing a 404) or conflicting with the inline JavaScript
- The working version doesn't have this script tag

**To fix your site:**
1. Replace your current `index.html` with the fixed version in the artifact above
2. Or simply delete the line `<script src="js/homepage.js"></script>` from your current file

This should immediately restore your site to working condition since everything else is identical to the working version.

If you're curious about what's in `homepage.js` (if it exists), you could check `client/public/js/homepage.js` to see what the optimization tried to extract. But since your site works perfectly without it, you can safely remove the reference.
