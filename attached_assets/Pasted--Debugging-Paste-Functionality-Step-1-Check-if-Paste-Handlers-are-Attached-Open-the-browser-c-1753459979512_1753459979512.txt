# Debugging Paste Functionality

## Step 1: Check if Paste Handlers are Attached

Open the browser console (F12) and look for these messages when the page loads:
```
‚úÖ Paste handler attached to description field
‚úÖ Paste handler attached to content field
```

**If you DON'T see these messages**, there's an issue with the handler attachment.

## Step 2: Test Basic Function

In the console, type:
```javascript
testPasteHandling()
```

This should show:
- Original text
- Processed HTML  
- With links version

**If this doesn't work**, the processing functions are broken.

## Step 3: Test Paste Detection

1. Click "+ Ajouter" 
2. Switch to "Communiqu√©s / News"
3. Click in the **Contenu complet** text area
4. Paste ANY text (even just "hello world")
5. **Watch the console** - you should see:
   ```
   üî• PASTE EVENT TRIGGERED for field: content
   üìù Raw pasted content length: X
   üîß Processed content length: Y
   ‚úÖ Paste processing completed successfully
   ```

**If you DON'T see these messages**, the paste event isn't firing.

## Step 4: Check What's Being Saved

Before clicking "Sauvegarder", in the console type:
```javascript
document.getElementById('content').value
```

This should show the text you pasted. Then type:
```javascript
document.getElementById('content').getAttribute('data-processed-content')
```

This should show the processed HTML version.

## Step 5: Manual Test

Try this simple test:
1. Click in the content area
2. **Type** (don't paste): "Test with link https://example.com"
3. Save it
4. See if it appears with the link properly formatted

## Quick Fix: Simple Paste Handler

If the above debugging shows the paste isn't being detected, add this to your console:

```javascript
// Test if paste events work at all
document.getElementById('content').addEventListener('paste', function(e) {
    console.log('SIMPLE PASTE DETECTED!', e);
});
```

Then try pasting again and see if you get "SIMPLE PASTE DETECTED!" in the console.

## Tell Me What You See

Run through steps 1-3 above and tell me:
1. Do you see the "‚úÖ Paste handler attached" messages?
2. Does `testPasteHandling()` work?
3. Do you see the "üî• PASTE EVENT TRIGGERED" messages when pasting?

This will help me identify exactly where the issue is occurring.
