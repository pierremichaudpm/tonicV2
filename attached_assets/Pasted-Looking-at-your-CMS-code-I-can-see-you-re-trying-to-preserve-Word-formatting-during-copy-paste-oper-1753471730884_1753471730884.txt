Looking at your CMS code, I can see you're trying to preserve Word formatting during copy-paste operations. You're right that this can become a rabbit hole! Word generates extremely complex HTML with lots of proprietary markup.

Here's a cleaner approach that should help you escape the rabbit hole while still preserving the important formatting:I've created a cleaner Word paste handler that should help you escape the rabbit hole. Here's how to integrate this improved approach into your existing CMS:## Key Improvements in This Solution:

1. **Structured Processing**: The `WordProcessor` class provides a clean, organized approach to handling Word HTML
2. **Better HTML Parsing**: Uses the DOM API properly to traverse and process nodes
3. **Preserves More Formatting**: 
   - Font sizes (mapped to Tailwind classes)
   - Bold, italic, underline
   - Headings (H1-H6)
   - Lists (ordered and unordered)
   - Tables
   - Links
   - Blockquotes

4. **Cleaner Output**: Removes all Word-specific cruft while keeping the important formatting

## How to Integrate:

1. Replace your existing paste handling functions with the new `WordProcessor` class
2. The enhanced `handlePaste` function will automatically process both HTML and plain text
3. The preview system will show the formatted content with proper styling

## Tips to Escape the Rabbit Hole:

1. **Don't try to preserve everything** - Word HTML is incredibly complex. Focus on the formatting that matters (bold, italic, links, headings, lists)

2. **Use the DOM API** - Instead of regex parsing, use the browser's built-in DOM parsing capabilities

3. **Test with real Word documents** - Create test documents with various formatting and use them to refine your processor

4. **Fallback gracefully** - Always have a plain text fallback when HTML processing fails

5. **Consider using a library** - If you need even more advanced features, consider libraries like:
   - `mammoth.js` - Specifically designed for converting Word documents
   - `turndown` - For converting HTML to Markdown (easier to store and process)

The solution I've provided should handle 90% of typical Word formatting while keeping the code maintainable and avoiding the complexity rabbit hole!
