You're right to question this! Let's verify if `index-working.html` actually works. Here's a systematic debugging approach:

**DEBUGGING STEPS TO TEST RIGHT NOW:**

1. **Test index-working.html directly:**
   ```bash
   # In Replit, open the preview and navigate to:
   https://[your-replit-url]/index-working.html
   ```
   Does this work? If not, then the "working" file is also broken.

2. **Check if CSS files exist:**
   ```bash
   ls -la client/public/css/
   # Should show:
   # - shared.css
   # - 4k-presentation.css
   # - tailwind-local.css
   ```

3. **Check if images exist:**
   ```bash
   ls -la client/public/images/
   # Should show all the logo and hero images
   ```

4. **Open Browser DevTools (F12) and check:**
   - **Console tab**: What errors do you see?
   - **Network tab**: Any 404s (red lines)?
   - **Elements tab**: Is the HTML structure there but invisible?

**COMMON ISSUES:**

1. **Wrong serving directory** - Maybe Replit is serving from `/client/public/` but the HTML expects to be in root
2. **Missing CSS files** - The optimization might have deleted or moved CSS files
3. **Tailwind purged too aggressively** - Classes like `from-pink-600` might have been removed

**QUICK TEST - Create a minimal test file:**Save this `test-minimal.html` file in the same directory as your `index.html` and open it. This will tell us:

1. ✅ **If CSS files are loading** (you'll see green "Loaded:" messages)
2. ✅ **If images are found** (logo will show or error)
3. ✅ **If Tailwind is working** (pink gradient box)
4. ✅ **If JavaScript runs** (success message)
5. ✅ **What paths are being used** (helps identify path issues)

**Share with me:**
1. Screenshot of what this test page shows
2. Browser console errors (F12 → Console)
3. The URL you're accessing (is it `localhost`, `replit.app`, etc?)

**Also check your file structure:**
```bash
# Run this in Replit console:
find client/public -name "*.css" -o -name "*.html" | sort
```

This will show us if files are in the expected locations. The issue might be:
- Files were moved during optimization
- Server is looking in wrong directory
- Tailwind CSS was rebuilt without the required classes

Let's see what the test page reveals!
