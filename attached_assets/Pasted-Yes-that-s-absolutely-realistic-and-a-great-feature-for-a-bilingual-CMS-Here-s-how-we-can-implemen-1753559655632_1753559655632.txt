Yes, that's absolutely realistic and a great feature for a bilingual CMS! Here's how we can implement automatic French-to-English translation while maintaining the ability to edit the English version:Perfect! I've implemented the automatic French-to-English translation feature with the following capabilities:

## Key Features:

1. **Automatic Translation**:
   - When you create or edit content in French, it automatically creates/updates an English version
   - The system uses the same ID for both language versions to keep them linked

2. **Manual Override**:
   - Auto-translated content is marked with a yellow "Auto-translated" badge
   - When you manually edit an auto-translated item, the badge is removed
   - The system respects manual edits - it won't override manually edited English content

3. **Synchronized Deletion**:
   - When you delete an item, it's removed from both languages
   - You'll see a confirmation message indicating deletion from both languages

4. **Visual Indicators**:
   - Auto-translated items show a yellow badge ("Auto-traduit" in French, "Auto-translated" in English)
   - This helps you quickly identify which content needs review

## Implementation Details:

Currently, I've added a **placeholder translation function** that you can easily replace with a real translation API. The code includes examples for three popular translation services:

1. **Google Cloud Translation API** - Good general-purpose translation
2. **DeepL API** - Excellent quality for European languages, especially French ↔ English
3. **Microsoft Translator API** - Part of Azure Cognitive Services

### Important Security Note:
Never put API keys directly in client-side code! Instead, create a server endpoint (`/api/translate`) that handles the translation requests and keeps your API keys secure on the server.

## How it Works:

1. Create content in French → Automatically creates English version
2. Edit French content → Updates English version (only if it was auto-translated)
3. Edit English content → Removes auto-translated flag, future French edits won't affect it
4. Delete content → Removes from both languages

This gives you the best of both worlds: efficiency through automation while maintaining full control for quality translations when needed.
