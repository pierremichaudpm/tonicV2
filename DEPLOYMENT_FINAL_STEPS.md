# Final Steps to Complete CMS Setup

Your website is now deployed at: https://website-migrator-pmicho.replit.app

## Step 1: Add Environment Variables

In your Replit project:

1. Go to the **Secrets** tab (in the left sidebar)
2. Add these two environment variables:

```
Key: ADMIN_URL
Value: https://website-migrator-pmicho.replit.app/admin

Key: PUBLIC_URL  
Value: https://website-migrator-pmicho.replit.app
```

## Step 2: Redeploy

After adding the environment variables, click the **Deploy** button one more time.

## Step 3: Test CMS Access

Once redeployed, go to:
https://website-migrator-pmicho.replit.app/admin

The CMS login should now work properly without redirecting to localhost.

## What These Variables Fix

- **ADMIN_URL**: Tells Strapi where to redirect after login
- **PUBLIC_URL**: Sets the base URL for the CMS

Without these, Strapi defaults to localhost:1337, which causes the login redirect issue you experienced.

## Your Website Status

✅ Main website: Fully functional  
✅ Bilingual support: French/English working  
✅ All pages: About, Jobs, Contact, News working  
⚠️ CMS: Needs environment variables to work beyond login  

The website works perfectly - this final step just enables content management through the CMS.
