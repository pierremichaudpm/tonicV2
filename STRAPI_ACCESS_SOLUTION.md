# Final Solution for Strapi Access

## The Issue
Strapi is running successfully on port 3001 (confirmed by process list), but Replit's proxy system isn't exposing it through the expected URLs.

## Working Solution

### Option 1: Direct Port Access in Replit
1. In your Replit workspace, look for the **"Ports"** or **"Networking"** tab
2. Find port 3001 and click to expose/open it
3. This will give you the exact working URL

### Option 2: Use SSH Tunneling (Advanced)
If you have SSH access to your Replit:
```bash
ssh -L 3001:localhost:3001 your-replit-workspace
```
Then access at: http://localhost:3001/admin

### Option 3: Proxy Through Main App
Since the main Express app is accessible, we could add a proxy route:
```javascript
app.use('/admin', proxy('http://localhost:3001'));
```

## Why Standard URLs Don't Work
- Replit's networking has changed how it exposes non-primary ports
- Port 3001 needs explicit exposure through Replit's interface
- The workspace--3001 URL pattern may be deprecated

## Recommendation
For production use, deploy Strapi separately on:
- Render.com (free tier)
- Railway.app
- Heroku
- Or use a headless CMS service like Strapi Cloud

Your website works perfectly without the live CMS using the static fallback system.
