# Next Steps: Strapi CMS Hosting

## Current Status
✅ **Website**: Fully deployed and functional at https://website-migrator-pmicho.replit.app
✅ **Content**: Displaying correctly from static JSON files
❌ **CMS**: Cannot run on Replit deployment (single process limitation)

## What Needs to Happen Next

### Deploy Strapi on a Dedicated Server
Strapi needs its own hosting because:
- It requires a separate Node.js process
- Needs persistent file storage for media uploads
- Requires its own database connection

### Recommended Hosting Options

#### 1. **Render.com** (Recommended)
- Free tier available
- Easy PostgreSQL database
- Automatic deployments from GitHub
- Good for Strapi

#### 2. **Railway.app**
- Simple deployment
- Built-in database support
- Pay-as-you-go pricing

#### 3. **Heroku**
- Well-established platform
- Free tier discontinued but reliable

## Deployment Steps for Next Phase

1. **Choose a hosting platform**
2. **Deploy the `/cms` folder as a separate application**
3. **Set environment variables** including:
   - Database connection
   - ADMIN_URL = https://your-strapi-domain.com/admin
   - PUBLIC_URL = https://your-strapi-domain.com
4. **Update website to connect to external CMS API**

## Your Website Works Now
- All pages are live and functional
- Content displays from static files
- Professional presentation ready
- CMS can be added later when needed

The CMS integration is complete in code - it just needs separate hosting to run in production.
